                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">For this project, my partner Dean and I used the instruction guide to put together a Prusa MINI 3D Printer. We came across a couple different issues, but were able to solve them. We also then calibrated our printer and loaded filament.</p>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">One thing that took some getting used to, was the way the instructions were written. At times, they were quite unclear and the photos were difficult to utalize. The instructions weren't like IKEA furnature, where everything is very obvious and well indicated. Getting used to thnking about the printer in terms of the Y axis, X axis, etc, was an adjustment, but we were able to do it. If I were to rewrite the instructions, I would try and make them more clear by stating more explicity what I mean, and also by making the photos larger and better quality. I think this would make the build a lot more intuative and easier. </p>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">The issues that we came across were pretty simple, usually we just had to go back a step or losen a screw. One part that was slightly more difficult was fititng all the wiring into the little box at the bottom. There was a very specific layout that the wires had to be in in order for the box to close. We had to try a couple of different times by taking the wires out and putting them back in, but eventually we were able to get it all to fit!</p>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">The part of the build I most enjoyed was the Haribo break! While I am not able to eat gelatin, I thought it was a fun touch and was a nice addition to the build. Below is a picture of us bulding the printer and a picture of us lining up the gummy bears on the plate :)</p>
