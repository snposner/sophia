                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">This week, we worked on making e-NABLE hands! We made the Phoenix Hand V3. I paired up with Ifigenia and we downloaded the hand from the website. We put all the components of the hand out into ideaMaker. The hardest part was getting all the pieces to fit onto the build plate without intersecting. We had scaled it to 150%, so it was a lot larger than We were able to do it though, and started our print on a raise. We didn’t change any of the print settings, instead we got rid of the supports and just enabled a raft. We didn’t enable supports, as this hand was designed to be printed without supports. Below is a photo of the sliced hand in ideamaker.  </p>

                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4"> The print came out well! The only issue we had was that the top on the inside of the hand part had some loose filament but I cut it off and didn’t have any further issues. See below for the picture. </p>
                            <figure class="mb-4-lg-8"><img class="img-fluid rounded" src="images/phoenix_issue.jpeg" alt="..." width="500" height="500" /></figure>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4"> When it came to assembling the hand, I found two guides to assembly. One was a video and one was a slideshow. They were both very difficult to find, and I had to have help finding them. I also didn’t realize this until later, but the slideshow didn’t show the version of the hand that I was working on. It would have been helpful if they could have linked these guides to the page where we downloaded the STL files or made them easier to access.  </p>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4"> Assembling the hand was fairly easy. Finding all the pieces and figuring out what went where was simple for me. The only issue I came across was mentioned above. I decided to use the slideshow guide and didn’t realize until too late it was the incorrect version of the phoenix hand. This meant that, instead of looping the string at the top, I had to tie each individual string to both the fingertip and the top. This meant more knots and probably means the hand is less study in the long-term, but it didn’t affect the functionality in the short term. I switched halfway through my build to the video guide and had no issues after that. I finished the hand and it ended up functioning well! Below is a picture of my hand while building it, once it was done, and a video showing its functionality.  </p>

                            <figure class="mb-4-lg-8"><img class="img-fluid rounded" src="images/phoenix_finished.jpeg" alt="..." width="500" height="500" /></figure>
                            <video width="500px" height="500px" controls="controls">
                            <source src="images/phoenix_functionality.MOV" type="video/mp4" />
                            </video>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4"> Lastly, I designed a hand with a new function. My parents are avid gardeners, so I wanted to design a hand that would help a person with gardening. When it comes to gardening, there are many small handheld tools one must use. The handles are fairly skinny and could be difficult to grip with the prosthetic. I wanted to design a hand with a finger that comes out and can switch between different gardening tools in order to help the person garden. Below is a sketch of my idea. </p>
