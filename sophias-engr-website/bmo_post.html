                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">This week we worked on making alarm clocks, as well as printing the boxes that they go in. To start off, we needed to learn how to solder in order to make the clocks. My partner, Greg, and I learned how to solder pretty quickly. We both struggled to figure out the exact angle that worked when soldering, but we ended up figuring it out and were able to start working on our alarm clock. Below is a picture of me soldering.  </p>
                            <figure class="mb-4-lg-8"><img class="img-fluid rounded" src="images/soldering.jpeg" alt="..." width="500" height="500" /></figure>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">On the second day of this project, I continued working on the alarm clock, while Greg worked on starting to draw up a design in fusion360. We decided to base our alarm clock cover off of BMO, an adventure time character. While Greg worked on measuring and designing, I continued soldering. One issue that I faced was that when I flipped the board after putting the piece in, it would slide down. I fixed this by bending the wires so that it would stay in while I soldered it, and this worked much better. </p>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">Another issue that I faced was when I finished the board and tried to get it to work, it just beeped at me and didn’t turn on. I checked all my solder and made sure there were no gaps/bridges. After I did this, it still wasn’t working. I realized that one of my pieces was flipped, so I turned it around and the alarm clock worked! We started our first BMO print and our first cover print. Below is a picture of what BMO looks like, a picture of our cover in fusion360 and a picture of our BMO in fusion360. For print settings, we printed it in a Raise and used the default settings. We oriented it so that we didn’t need supports. </p>

                            <figure class="mb-4-lg-8"><img class="img-fluid rounded" src="images/bmo_v1.jpeg" alt="..." width="500" height="500" /></figure>

                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4"> The 3D prints turned out well, the cover for the clock had the cutouts in the right spot. The only issue was that the buttons were difficult to reach. The cover also didn’t fit in the BMO body, so we were going to have to make the hole in the BMO body bigger. BMO also didn’t stand up on its own, so we needed to change the feet to have a larger flat surface area. Greg worked on fixing the BMO body, while I worked on fixing the clock cover. Below are the pictures of the printed BMO, and the second version of the BMO body in prusa slicer. </p>

                            <figure class="mb-4-lg-8"><img class="img-fluid rounded" src="images/bmo_prusa.jpeg" alt="..." width="500" height="500" /></figure>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4"> I worked on fixing the alarm clock cover. I added a hole where the speaker was, where the LED lights were, and I wanted to add buttons that would press into the buttons on the clock. This was my first real time using fusion, besides the first fusion assignment we had, and there was a bit of a learning curve. Trying to figure out the best way to navigate the screen and change my view was frustrating, but I eventually figured it out. I decided to make three new bodies for the buttons that had an interlocking system outside, so they could move up and down but not out of the cover. Below is a sketch of what I did and what the cover looked like in fusion. I was out of town the weekend I printed this due to a family emergency, so I sent the STL file to Vincent and he ran the print on prusa for me, which means I don’t have the print settings. </p>

                            <figure class="mb-4-lg-8"><img class="img-fluid rounded" src="images/final_cover_fusion.jpeg" alt="..." width="500" height="500" /></figure>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4"> The new BMO body turned out great! It stood up by itself and the cover of it fit perfectly. Unfortunately, the new cover didn’t go as well. The speaker hole was in the wrong spot and I hadn’t given the buttons enough clearance between the cover, which meant they meshed together and couldn’t move. Below is a picture of the new BMO body with the new cover.  </p>
                            <figure class="mb-4-lg-8"><img class="img-fluid rounded" src="images/new_bmo_cover.jpeg" alt="..." width="500" height="500" /></figure>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4"> I decided to get rid of the speaker hole, because we could still hear the speaker without it and I wanted to focus on the new buttons. I made each button smaller so they wouldn’t mesh with the body, and when we printed it this time, they worked much better!! I didn’t change any settings, except I added supports between the build plate and the cover. We added it into the body with the clock and we had a BMO with a working clock and working buttons! This project was really cool because it allowed us to get more comfortable with fusion, and it helped me think outside of the box and design something functional, like buttons. Below is a picture of the new cover in fusion, in ideamaker, and the whole thing put together! </p>
