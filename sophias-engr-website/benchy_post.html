                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">For this project, we printed and then refined different versions of a mini boat called a 3D benchy. We started with the original, unedited benchy to calibrate our machines and see if any issues arose. We then printed a benchy trying to make the print as fast as we could without ruining the print. And lastly, we printed a benchy with tubes on the side in hopes that it would float.</p>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">Our first benchy (as shown in the photo above) was pretty good. The issue that we came across was that there was a decent amount of stringing (as shown in the picture below). While this issue definitely had a lot to do with temperature, we wanted to try other ways of fixing it. We did this by making the retraction speed faster and it actually helped a lot with our second benchy. </p>
                            <figure class="mb-4-lg-8"><img class="img-fluid rounded" src="images/stringing_benchy.jpeg" alt="..." width="500" height="500" /></figure>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">With our second benchy, we hoped to make the process as fast as possible without ruining the print. We did this in a few ways. We increased the print speed, increased the layer height, decreased wall thickness, and reduced the infill. By doing this we decreased the print time from over 2 hours to 49 minutes. Overall, the print went well. The quality was not as good as the first benchy, but it still printed decently and the stringing was significantly reduced. Below is a picture of our second benchy and a time lapse of it being printed.</p>

                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">Lastly, we made a floating benchy. We noticed that if you put the regular benchy in water, it technically would float but it would flip upside down. We wanted to fix this issue, as it is a boat after all. We did this by adding tubes on the sides (like how one might see rafts on a regular boat) in hopes that this would fix the issue. We added the tubes using fusion360 and made sure to also increase the retraction speed again to prevent stringing. The benchy ended up being a success and was able to float! Shown below is a picture of our third benchy and a video of us putting it in water. </p>
